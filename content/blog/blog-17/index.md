Gcloud or Cloud SDK is the command Line interface for interacting with Google Cloud Resources. Similar to the terminal that you may use in your code editor, Gcloud can be used as an alternative to the Cloud Console in GCP to manage resources like : Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Kubernetes, Cloud DataProc, Cloud DNS, Cloud Deployment manager and more.. 

Most GCP services can be managed from CLI using GCloud, such as Compute Engine VMs, Managed Instance Groups, Databases and more. You can create, delete, update, and read existing resources and perform actions like deployments as well. 

Remember: Some GCP services have specific CLI tools. For example, Cloud Storage uses “gsutil”, Cloud BigQuery uses “bq”, Cloud BigTable uses “cbt”, and Google Kubernetes Engine uses “kubectl”. 

GCloud is part of the Google Cloud SDK, or a set of tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud. You can also use Cloud Shel if you don’t want to install on your local machine. This can be found at the top of the page in GCP.
