After about 2 years of learning, practicing, and growing in the Ruby Programming Language, I finally decided to peek at the language that I started learning when I first decided to become a software engineer. Almost 3 years ago, I purchased a MacBook Air with almost all the money that I had left in my account and purchased a Udemy course in Python. I had picked Python because after doing some research I learned that it “should” be the easiest language to learn. But let me tell you something, picking the EASIEST coding language is like choosing your favorite child; there’s no real good answer. I struggled a lot and the higher-level concepts like object-oriented programming were just too much for me at the time, so I quit for a while. Ultimately though I found myself at coding bootcamp and learned a lot of what I know today while there. 

So now, I’m taking another deep dive into Python with fresh eyes! Hoping to gain some expertise in this powerful language so I can be a lot more marketable in my job search! Wish me luck!
