In a world where the word “full stack” is thrown out so regularly, after spending a little time in the field, you quickly realize that it’s important to specialize in something. While it is possible to work as a full stack developer professionally, especially in a startup environment where it may be necessary, in many situations you’ll find companies that want you to specialize in something, even if they’re willing to hire and teach it to you. 

For me, I began my journey thinking I’d be more of a backend developer since most of my learning was in Ruby, but as I’ve gotten deeper and deeper into JavaScript/Rails, I have learned how deep the front end can be and specifically when creating side projects, spending time on both front end and back end can be super time consuming. In the job search process as a frontend developer, you’ll want to spend most of your time finding ways to showcase your CSS and design talent, and I know that figuring out how to plug data into your application can be a hard thing to decide. It’s still going to be important to show that you know how to work with data from an API so I believe a Headless CMS is the best way to get your point across without having to take the time to build out an entire backend.

A Headless CMS provides all of the backend functionality of a Content Management System without the restrictions that come with a traditional one. Traditional CMS options like WordPress can be great for freelancers projects for companies, but they can be very inflexible. Those types of platforms allow you to build your site on top of the CMS, with built in themes and templates that must adhere to the rules of the platform. Because of this, I have found it more difficult to gain much knowledge from using them, unless the goal is to learn that platform.

The benefit of a Headless CMS is that the CMS is not the foundation. The content is stored in one place, and you can still make all of your API calls. However, the system is much more flexible, and you can create and customize your website from scratch. This route gives you the ability to put all of your focus into the designs of your frontend while still showcasing your ability to work with an API. Give examples like Storyblok, Contentful, or ButterCMS a try and get building!
