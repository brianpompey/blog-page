There are several categories of databases in Google Cloud: Relational (OLTP and OLAP), Document, Key Value, Graph, and In memory (among others). When choosing a category, there are factors that must be considered such as schema type, level of transaction properties, latency requirements, number of transactions, and amount of storage needed. 

Relational Databases are some of the most used categories because they were the only option possible until a decade ago. With relational databases, we get a predefined schema with tables and relationships and very strong transactional capabilities. There are two types of Relational Databases: OLTP (Online transaction processing) and OLAP (Online Analytics Processing).
