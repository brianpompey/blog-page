So I've been learning Python for a few years now on and off and I've got a lot of the basics down. But one of the main issues we tend to face when learning a new programming language is the question: "How do I use this stuff??"

Application of new skills is something that we have to keep up with and I believe the best way to do that is to ..... make projects! So in this series, I'm going to commit to building a new project in Python everyday so I can learn to apply different techniques and technologies in real time.

First up, I created a simple Youtube Video Downloader script. Many of us grew up watching youtube and needing good wifi to stop the videos from buffering so this project brought me back to the good old days when I wish I had known how to use it.

To start, we're using a Python library called pytube.

from pytube import YouTube
